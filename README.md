# File-caching-Proxy-for-DS

A LRU file caching proxy with one-copy semantic for distributed system to improve performance of file operations between client and server


## Synopsis

## Code Example

The tools directory contains binary tools that perform I/O operations. These will work on Linux x86 64-bit platforms (e.g., Andrew servers).

The lib directory has lib440lib.so. This is an interposition library that will redirect file operations to RPC calls. It is used just like mylib.so in [a link](https://github.com/martin31hao/C-lib-for-data-serialization/tree/master/Interpose):

LD_PRELOAD=lib/lib440lib.so tools/440read foo

(Use env if you are not running bash).

This will connect to a proxy port specified in proxyport15440 environment variable.  

The lib directory also has the RPCreceiver class and its support interfaces. This class implements the stubs in Java compatiable with lib440lib.so. Your proxy code should make use of RPCreceiver to interface with the clients. 

The doc directory has autogenerated javadoc documentation on RPCreceiver and related classes. 


## Installation

Run "make" in src directory to build the programs.

## Tests

The src directory has a server and proxy implementation of a server and proxy class, that shows how to interface to RPCreceiver.  

To compile the proxy, make sure your CLASSPATH environment variable includes the absolute paths
to the lib and sample directories:

export CLASSPATH=$PWD/lib:$PWD/src

(Use setenv if not using bash).

Then cd into the src directory and run make.  Now you can run the proxy using:

proxyport15440=XXXX java Proxy

Running a tool with the LD_PRELOAD of lib440lib.so will connect to the Proxy, though none of the operations are actually implemented.
